# üéµ Centralized Music Platform

A **centralized music streaming platform** that uses external APIs (Spotify, YouTube) for discovery while building your own legal audio catalog. This approach avoids copyright issues while creating real value for users and artists.

## üéØ **Strategy Overview**

**One-liner strategy:** Build a centralized music player that uses Spotify/YouTube for **discovery metadata**, but plays actual audio from **policy-safe sources** you host (open-licensed/artist-uploaded). Over time, grow that owned catalog until you're no longer dependent on external platforms.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Frontend (Next.js 15 - App Router)**
- **Discovery UI** powered by Spotify/YouTube metadata
- **Unified track pages** that resolve playable sources from your catalog
- **Artist upload system** for content creation
- **Unified search** across all platforms
- **Smart playlist builder** (premium feature)

### **Backend (Supabase)**
- **PostgreSQL** database with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Supabase Auth** for user management
- **Supabase Storage** for audio files
- **Real-time subscriptions** for live updates
- **Edge Functions** for processing

### **External Integrations**
- **Spotify Web API** - Search, metadata, OAuth
- **YouTube Data API v3** - Search, metadata, OAuth
- **Stripe** - Subscription management
- **FFmpeg** - Audio processing (planned)

## üìä **Database Schema**

### **Core Tables**
- `users` - Enhanced with artist roles
- `content_items` - Unified metadata from all sources
- `sources` - Playable audio files (your owned content)
- `licenses` - License information for each source
- `uploads` - Artist upload tracking
- `plays` - Analytics and play tracking
- `feature_flags` - Premium feature toggles

### **Key Features**
- **Content matching** between external IDs and your sources
- **Fuzzy matching** by title/artist/duration
- **License tracking** for compliance
- **Analytics** for insights and recommendations

## üéµ **How It Works**

### **1. Search & Discovery**
1. User searches for music
2. System queries Spotify, YouTube, and your catalog
3. Results are merged and deduplicated
4. Content matching tries to find playable sources
5. UI shows availability across platforms

### **2. Playback Resolution**
1. **Own catalog** ‚Üí Direct audio playback
2. **Spotify/YouTube** ‚Üí External link redirect
3. **No source** ‚Üí "Request upload" CTA

### **3. Artist Uploads**
1. Artist uploads audio file
2. System extracts metadata
3. File is processed (transcoding planned)
4. Content item and source are created
5. Admin review and approval
6. Track becomes playable

### **4. Content Matching**
1. **ISRC matching** (strongest)
2. **Exact title/artist** matching
3. **Fuzzy matching** with confidence scores
4. **Manual matching** for admin curation
